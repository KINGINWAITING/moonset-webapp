          question: "What is MoonSet?",
          answer: "MoonSet is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project built on the Ethereum blockchain with the core mission of exposing what we believe to be the meticulously orchestrated deception surrounding the 1969 moon landing. Our project leverages blockchain technology to unite a global community around the pursuit of truth."
        },
        {
          question: "Is MoonSet just another meme coin?",
          answer: "While MoonSet shares the characteristic of community-driven value with meme coins, our foundation lies in a decades-long pursuit of what we believe to be a significant historical truth. Our project is not predicated on fleeting internet trends but on a growing global awareness and critical re-evaluation of the evidence surrounding the moon landing."
        },
        {
          question: "Why use blockchain technology for this purpose?",
          answer: "Blockchain technology provides transparency, immutability, and censorship resistanceâ€”all crucial for preserving and sharing research that challenges powerful established narratives. The decentralized nature ensures that our findings and evidence cannot be easily silenced or removed."
        },
        {
          question: "What evidence do you have that the moon landing was faked?",
          answer: "Our core arguments are based on a meticulous analysis of photographic anomalies (the absence of stars, waving flag, inconsistent shadows), technical challenges (radiation exposure, lunar dust problems), and political context (Cold War pressure). For a detailed breakdown of our evidence, please visit our About page or read our full Whitepaper."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is the MOONSET token?",
          answer: "MOONSET is an ERC-20 utility token on the Ethereum blockchain that serves as the cornerstone of the MoonSet ecosystem. It is designed to empower individuals who share our conviction about the lunar landing and to incentivize the collective pursuit and dissemination of truth."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the total supply of MOONSET tokens?",
          answer: "The total supply of MOONSET tokens is 10,000,000,000 (Ten Billion). The tokens are distributed as follows: 15% to Founders and Core Team, 25% for Community Airdrop and Initial DEX Offering, 30% for Research and Development Fund, 20% for Community Rewards and Incentives, and 10% for Strategic Partnerships and Advisors."
        },
        {
          question: "How can I acquire MOONSET tokens?",
          answer: "MOONSET tokens will be available through our Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on decentralized exchanges. Additionally, we plan to distribute a portion of tokens through community airdrops to early supporters. For the latest information on token acquisition, please visit our Dashboard."
        },
        {
          question: "What utility does the MOONSET token provide?",
          answer: "MOONSET tokens serve multiple functions: they grant governance rights for community decision-making, provide access to premium content in our decentralized lunar truth archive, incentivize content creation and research contributions, and can be staked for rewards in our ecosystem."

        },
        {
          question: "What kind of content is valued in the MoonSet ecosystem?",
          answer: "We value well-researched articles, in-depth video analyses, compelling documentaries, innovative technological tools, and other content that furthers our understanding of the lunar landing controversy. Quality, authenticity, and originality are highly regarded in our ecosystem."
        },
        {
          question: "Is there a roadmap for the MoonSet project?",
          answer: "Yes, our roadmap consists of four phases: Genesis and Token Launch (Q2 2025), Community Building and Ecosystem Development (Q3-Q4 2025), Expansion and Awareness (Q1-Q2 2026), and Long-Term Sustainability and Impact (ongoing). Each phase has specific objectives to advance our mission."
        },
        {
          question: "How is the Research and Development Fund managed?",
          answer: "The Research and Development Fund, which constitutes 30% of the total token supply, is managed through community governance. MOONSET holders can participate in voting on key decisions related to fund allocation for research projects, content creation, and development of the decentralized lunar truth archive."

          question: "Is investing in MOONSET tokens risky?",
          answer: "Yes, investing in cryptocurrencies, including MOONSET, involves significant risks, and you could lose your entire investment. The value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and is subject to market fluctuations. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before investing."
        },

          question: "How are smart contracts secured in the MoonSet ecosystem?",
          answer: "All smart contracts in the MoonSet ecosystem undergo rigorous auditing processes by reputable security firms before deployment. We implement industry best practices for smart contract development and maintain transparency by making our code open-source for community review."
        },
        {
          question: "What measures are in place to prevent token price manipulation?",
          answer: "We implement vesting schedules for team tokens, liquidity locking mechanisms, and transparent token economics to mitigate the risk of price manipulation. Additionally, our governance system allows for community oversight of major token movements and decisions."
        },
